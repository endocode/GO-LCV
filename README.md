# GO-License Compliance Validator

This code is a GO version of [LCV-CM](https://github.com/endocode/LCV-CM).
LCV takes input a json generated by the QMSTR JSON Reporter and analyzes all the licenses present on it.

The Compatibility Matrix (CM) will match these licenses. The CM is represented in the `licenses.csv` file.
The GO version of the validator is currently not completely implementing the matching logic, which still must be implemented.
